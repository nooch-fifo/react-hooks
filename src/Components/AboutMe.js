                        <p style={{ marginTop: 15 }}>As a junior software engineer and UX design enthusiast, Iâ€™m passionate about creating cutting-edge designs
                            for the user, while innovating efficient, full-stack software that benefits the future. Dedicated to making a
                            positive impact, my work ethic, eagerness to learn, and my collaborative communication skills allow me to
                            be a productive, self-accountable, and easy-to-work-with professional.</p>
                        <p>On a more personal note, I am more than just my career, and strive to keep a well-balanced and vivacious life in all aspects. Family and friends are dear to my heart, and I aspire to keep my social life in person with them, and less through the screen on my phone. I am keen on staying fit, whether that means going for runs or lifting weights. However, I am also a foodie, and there isn't a cusine (or sushi roll) I wouldn't try. Growing up in the NY/NJ area, I am a die-hard Yankees fan, and enjoy unwinding some nights watching a Michael Kay casted game, with a glass of red wine.</p>
