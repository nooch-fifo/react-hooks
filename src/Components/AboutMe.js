                             <p className="text-dark" style={{ marginTop: 25, fontSize: 17.5}}>After several recommendations from numerous senior colleagues & mentors, I decided the best personal project
                             I can build for my career, is none else, than a personal blog. This is a Full-Stack application with various microservices deployed to the Cloud. For the backend technologies,
                             I utilized Spring Boot with Gradle dependencies that include: Spring Boot Data JPA, Web, and JUnit. Furthermore, the frontend software used was React.js, with CRUD functionality
                             that persists from the React UI, to the API Endpoints, and into a MySQL database.</p>

Family and friends are dear to my heart, and I aspire to keep my social life in person with them, and less through the screen on my phone. I am keen on staying fit, whether that means going for runs or lifting weights. However, I am also a foodie, and there isn't a cusine (or sushi roll) I wouldn't try. Growing up in the NY/NJ area, I am a die-hard Yankees fan, and enjoy unwinding some nights watching a Michael Kay casted game, with a glass of red wine.</p> */}
